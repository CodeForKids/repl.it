Code For Kids repl.it
=======

An online environment for interactively exploring programming languages, based
on [jsREPL](https://github.com/replit/jsrepl).

Code For Kids (www.codeforkids.ca) has found that using repl.it is a great way to ensure that everyone is using the same version of langauges, and it avoids having to set them up across many different laptops.

Languages in use:
-----------------

* Ruby
* Python
* Javascript
* Lua

Running repl.it
---------------

Simply do ./start to start, ./stop to stop or ./restart to... restart the main repl.codeforkids.ca

To test your own code, do ./server.js 8888 (or any port) and it goes live to repl.codeforkids.ca:8888 (or any port). Ctrl-c to kill it.

Things on the radar
--------------------

* Update ruby to 2.1
* Change to CFK colours
* Add good example code under examples
